1. Find all sessions on PostgreSQL
select * from from pg_stat_activity;
2. Find idle queries
select * from from pg_stat_activity where state='idle';
3. To get queries running more than 30 minutes
select current_timestamp-query_start as runtime, datname,usename, query from pg_stat_activity
where state='active' and current_timestamp-query_start> '30 min'
order by 1 desc;
4. Check active sessions:
select current_timestamp-query_start as runtime, datname,usename, query from pg_stat_activity
where state='active'
order by 1 desc;
5. To see what users are running?
select datname,usename, state, query from pg_stat_activity;

To kill pid(session) from PostgreSQL?
SELECT 
    pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM 
    pg_stat_activity 
WHERE 
    -- don't kill my own connection!
    pid <> pg_backend_pid()
    -- don't kill the connections to other databases
    AND datname = 'db_name'
    ;
